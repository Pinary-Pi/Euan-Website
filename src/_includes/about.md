## About

Hello, I’m Euan Dandurand, a Computer Engineering student and self-taught composer from Southern California. I created this site to share the projects I’ve built and the music I’ve written with the world.

I’ve been fascinated by computers since I was young. My dad encouraged me by teaching me some basic programming skills, and from there I began working on personal projects that eventually led me to pursue Computer Engineering in college.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, I took up composition more seriously. I had always loved improvising on the piano, but I didn’t start writing music down until my mom encouraged me to after hearing an improvisation she particularly liked. Since then, I’ve written pieces for solo piano, ensembles, and choir, and in 2024 I was honored to be a finalist in the <a href="https://youngcomposerschallenge.org/finalists_2024.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Young Composers Challenge</a>.

Outside of school and music, I enjoy learning languages and am currently studying Spanish \(¡Hola!\) and Czech \(Ahoj!\). I also competed in gymnastics for five years and now coach the sport.
