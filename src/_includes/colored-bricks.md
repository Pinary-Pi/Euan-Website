# Colored Bricks

## A Minecraft Mod for Forge & Fabric

Colored Bricks was a project I began with the intention of teaching myself the Java programming language. Before starting this project, I had zero knowledge of how Java worked besides some fundamentals that apply to almost all programming languages. So, throughout the creation of this project I learned quite a lot. You can find the source code on <a href="https://github.com/Pinary-Pi/Colored-Bricks-Minecraft-Mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> and download it from <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/colored-bricks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modrinth</a> and <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/colored-bricks-mod" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CurseForge</a>.

This Minecraft mod adds brick blocks, stairs, slabs, walls, and flowerpots to the base game for each of the 16 vanilla Minecraft colors. It also creates two new categories of brick blocks which include ‘chiseled bricks’ and ‘cracked bricks’, the latter of which also comes in stair, slab, and wall forms. It’s available for both the Forge and Fabric mod loaders and for Minecraft versions from 1.16-1.21.8. Due to some of my own language skills and the help of others online, the mod supports 5 languages besides English: Czech, German, Japanese, Russian, and Taiwanese Mandarin.
